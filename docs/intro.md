# Intro

BillaBear is a standalone SaaS Subscription Management and Billing tool. It's designed to allow companies to solve their subscription management and billing problems with ease.

It intergrates with Stripe Billing, allowing you to easily take control over many parts of the billing process with Stripe Billing that aren't as nice as they could be. The ability to completely control your invoices, receipts, and email templates.

The documentation is split into two parts. One part is technical documentation, this is stuff such as how to deploy, how to configure background tasks, what each task does, etc. The other half is user documentation, this is how to create a product, how to edit templates, how to refund payments, etc.

There is also Swagger documentation that documents the API that is separate from this site. They can be found at [swagger.billabear.com](https://swagger.billabear.com).
