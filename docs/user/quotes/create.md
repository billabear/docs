# Creating Quotes

## Permissions

To create quotes for customers via the BillaBear admin system, you need to have a ROLE of Account Manager or higher.

## What Happens Next

After creating a quote:

1. The quote is saved in the system and assigned a unique identifier
2. You can view the quote in the quotes list
3. You can share the quote with the customer for their review
4. The customer can accept the quote, which will initiate the subscription and/or generate invoices for one-off items
5. You can track the status of the quote to see if it has been accepted, expired, or is still pending

## Tips for Creating Effective Quotes

- **Include All Relevant Items**: Make sure the quote includes all products or services the customer has expressed interest in
- **Check Pricing Carefully**: Verify that all prices are correct before creating the quote
- **Consider Tax Implications**: Set the appropriate tax status for each item based on your tax requirements
- **Review Before Sending**: Double-check all information before sharing the quote with the customer
