BillaBear helps deal with taxing customers correctly.

## Don't tax customers with a tax number

In some locations you don't need to collect tax for customers who have provided a tax id. 

If you're wanting to do that then you need to toogle it. 

## Prices for non-taxable customer

There are two types of prices one including tax and the other excludes tax.

For prices that exclude taxes then when the customer is not taxable they'll just pay the base price and there will be a 0% tax rate for them.

For prices that include taxes then the customer is still charged the base price but there are no taxes collected.
