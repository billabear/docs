Sadly, not all customers will have their subscriptions forever and it's often required to cancel a subscription.

## Timing

Cancelling a subscription isn't the same need for each customer. You can have a customer who wants to end their subscription at the end of the month, one who wants to end on a specific date due to contractual reasons, or one that wants it ended straight away.

To handle you can choose between:

* Instantly
* Defined Date
* End of Billing Period

## Refunds

You're able to issue a refund automatically when you cancel a subscription. There are two types of refunds allowed. One is a full refund and the other is a pro-rata refund.

### Full

A full Refund is a full refund for the last payment relating to that subscription.

### Pro-rata

Pro-rata is a refund that is pro-rata to the end of the day the cancellation is done.

A weekly subscription is divided by 7 to find the cost per day and then each day left in the subscription is added together to get the refund total.

A monthly subscription is divided by the number of days in that month to find the cost per day and then each day left in the subscription is added together to get the refund total.

A yearly subscription is divided by 365 to find the cost per day. Then each day left in the subscription is added together to get the refund total.
