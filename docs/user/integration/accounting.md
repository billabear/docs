BillaBear integrates with your finance software allowing you to have your finance software up to date with the actions happening within BillaBear.

The following data is synced to your finance software:

* Customer Data
* Payment Data
* Credit Data
* Refund Data
* Invoices

Invoices for customers who pay by invoice will also be checked in the finance software to see if it's been paid and removing the need to manually process this.
