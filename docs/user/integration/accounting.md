# Finance Integrations

BillaBear integrates with your finance software, keeping your accounting system up to date with all financial activities happening within BillaBear.

## What Data Is Synchronized

The following data is automatically synced to your finance software:

* Customer Data - Contact information and billing details
* Payment Data - All successful payments processed
* Credit Data - Credits applied to customer accounts
* Refund Data - All refunds issued

For customers who pay by invoice, BillaBear will automatically check your finance software to see if invoices have been paid, eliminating the need for manual verification.
