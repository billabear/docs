# Viewing Payments

## Accessing the Payments List

To access the main payments list:

## Understanding the Payments List

The payments list provides a tabular view of all payments with the following information:

* **ID**: The unique identifier for the payment
* **Customer**: The name of the customer who made the payment
* **Amount**: The payment amount and currency
* **Date**: When the payment was processed
* **Status**: The current status of the payment (e.g., Completed, Failed, Refunded)
* **Payment Method**: The method used for the payment (e.g., Credit Card, Bank Transfer)
* **Actions**: Buttons to view details or perform actions on the payment

## Filtering and Searching Payments

BillaBear offers several ways to find specific payments:

### Basic Search

Use the search box at the top of the payments list to search for:
* Customer names

### Advanced Filtering

Click the "Filters" button to access advanced filtering options:

* **Date Range**: Filter payments by date (e.g., last 30 days, custom range)
* **Amount Range**: Filter by payment amount
* **Payment Status**: Filter by payment status (e.g., Completed, Failed, Refunded)
* **Payment Method**: Filter by the method used
* **Customer**: Filter to show only a specific customer's payments

### Sorting Results

Click on any column header to sort the payments list by that column. Click again to reverse the sort order.

## Exporting Payment Data

1. Apply any desired filters to narrow down the data
2. Click the "Export" button
3. Select your preferred format (CSV, Excel)
4. The file will download to your computer

## Viewing Payment Details

To view detailed information about a specific payment:

1. Find the payment in the list
2. Click on the payment ID or the "View" button in the Actions column

This will take you to the [payment details page](./payment_details), which provides comprehensive information about the payment.

## Common Tasks from the Payments List

From the payments list, you can:

* Click "View" to see payment details
