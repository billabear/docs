BillaBear handles core actions via workflows which execute actions in order. If a workflow fails for whatever reason it can be restarted.

## Permissions

To be able to manage workflows via the BillaBear admin system you will need to have a ROLE of Account Manager or higher.

[Check the user roles here.](../user_roles/)

## How it works

The following actions create workflows

* Subscription Creation
* Subscription Cancellation
* Payment Failure
* Payment Succeeded
* Charge backs
* Invoice Created
* Refund created
* Charge back created

These have a series of actions if one fails you can restart the process.
