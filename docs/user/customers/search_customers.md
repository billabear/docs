In order to manage a customer's subscription and billing you need to be able to find the customers. 

There are the following filters:

* Email
* Reference
* External Reference

## Email

The email filter is a search for any email containing the value. If you search for "iain" it would match for:

* iain@billabear.com
* me@iain.sexy
* me@iaincambridge.me

## Reference

Reference this is a search for any reference containing the value.

## External Reference

External reference is the customer id from stripe. So if you have that you're able to search.
