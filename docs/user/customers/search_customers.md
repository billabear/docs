# Searching for Customers

Finding specific customers quickly is essential for efficient customer management. BillaBear provides a powerful search feature with multiple filters to help you locate customers based on different criteria.

## Why Search for Customers?

You may need to search for customers to:
- View or update customer information
- Check subscription status
- Process payments or refunds
- Respond to support inquiries
- Generate reports for specific customer segments

## Available Search Filters

BillaBear offers several filters to help you find customers:

### Email Filter

The email filter searches for any email address containing the value you enter. This is a partial match search, so you can enter just a portion of an email address.

**Example:** Searching for "iain" would match:
* iain@billabear.com
* me@iain.sexy
* me@iaincambridge.me

### Reference Filter

The reference filter searches for any customer reference containing the value you enter. References are internal identifiers that you can assign to customers for your own tracking purposes.

**Example:** If you use department codes like "SALES-123" as references, searching for "SALES" would find all customers with sales department references.

### External Reference Filter

The external reference filter searches for customers by their payment provider ID (such as Stripe customer ID). This is useful when reconciling accounts with your payment processor.

**Example:** If you have a Stripe customer ID like "cus_1234567890", you can search for it directly.
