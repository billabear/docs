# Products

The Products section in BillaBear is where you manage all aspects of your product offerings. This includes creating and managing your products, defining features, setting up subscription plans, and creating vouchers for special promotions.

## What You Can Do in the Products Section

### Products
Products are the core items or services that you offer to your customers. In BillaBear, a product serves as a container for features and subscription plans. Creating products is the first step in setting up your offerings.

### Features
Features are specific capabilities or aspects of your products. By defining features, you can clearly communicate what each product includes and create different subscription plans based on included features.

### Subscription Plans
Subscription plans define how customers can purchase your products. Each plan is associated with a product and includes specific features, pricing options, and billing schedules.

### Vouchers
Vouchers allow you to create special promotions, discounts, or trial offers for your products. You can use vouchers for marketing campaigns or to provide special pricing to specific customer segments.
