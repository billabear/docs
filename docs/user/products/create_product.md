# Creating a Product in BillaBear

Products are the foundation of your offerings in BillaBear. A product represents the core item or service that you sell to your customers. Before you can set up subscription plans or define features, you need to create a product.

## What is a Product?

In BillaBear, a product serves as a container for:
- Features that describe what the product includes
- Subscription plans that determine how customers can purchase the product
- Pricing options associated with those plans

For example, if you sell software, you might create products like "Basic CRM", "Advanced CRM", and "Enterprise CRM".

## Required Permissions

To create a product in BillaBear, you need to have a role of Account Manager or higher.
