# Understanding Usage Cost Estimates

When implementing usage-based billing, customers often want to know their current costs before the end of the billing cycle. BillaBear provides cost estimation features to address this need.

## Why Estimates Are Important

Cost estimates help your customers:
- Monitor their spending in real-time
- Make informed decisions about their usage
- Avoid unexpected charges at the end of the billing period
- Plan their budgets more effectively

## How Cost Estimates Work

BillaBear calculates cost estimates based on:
1. Usage data collected so far in the current billing period
2. The pricing rules configured for each metric
3. Any applicable discounts or minimums

## Limitations of Estimates

It's important to understand that these are estimates, not final charges, because:
- There may be a delay between when usage occurs and when it's recorded in BillaBear
- Some events in your system might not have been processed yet
- Usage patterns may change before the end of the billing period
- Complex pricing rules (like tiered pricing) can affect final calculations

## Viewing Cost Estimates

Customers can view their current cost estimates:
- In the customer portal dashboard
- Through the BillaBear API
- In automated usage reports (if configured)

## Communicating Estimates to Customers

When displaying estimates to customers, it's best practice to:
- Clearly label them as estimates, not final charges
- Indicate when the estimate was last updated
- Provide a breakdown by service or metric
- Explain that final charges may differ
- Consider showing usage trends to help with forecasting
