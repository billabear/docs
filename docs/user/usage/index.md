Usage based billing is where you bill users based on how much they use. This allows you to bill your customers fairly based on use. Your customers who use your service the most pay the most while your customers who use you the least pay the least.

How it works is that you have metrics and you then create events reporting new usage for the metric. You're able to set the pricing to be based on various type aggegration such as count, sum, max, etc.
