# Hosted Checkouts

A hosted checkout is a payment page that allows your customers to make payments or subscribe to your services through a dedicated URL. When customers access this URL, they can complete their purchase, and then they are redirected to a location you specify.

## What Are Hosted Checkouts?

Hosted checkouts provide a simple way to:

- Create payment links that you can share with customers
- Allow customers to purchase one-time items or subscribe to your services
- Collect payments without requiring customers to create an account first
- Provide a branded payment experience consistent with your company's identity

## Key Features

- **Customisable**: Associate with your brand settings for consistent branding
- **Flexible**: Include one-time items, subscriptions, or both
- **Customer Optional**: Create checkouts for existing customers or allow new customers to pay
- **Permanent or Temporary**: Create checkouts that never expire or set an expiration date
- **Custom Redirects**: Specify where customers are sent after successful payment or cancellation

## When to Use Hosted Checkouts

Hosted checkouts are ideal for:

- Sending payment links via email
- Creating a "Buy Now" button on your website
- Setting up a quick payment page for a specific product or service
- Allowing customers to self-serve when purchasing your offerings
