# Brand Settings

## Overview

Brand settings in BillaBear allow you to create and manage multiple brands for your billing system. This feature enables white-labelling of your billing process, making it possible to present different brand identities to different customers.

## What Are Brand Settings?

Brand settings define how your company appears to customers in invoices, emails, and other customer-facing communications. Each brand in BillaBear can have its own:

- **Brand Name**: The name that appears on invoices, emails, and other communications
- **Contact Information**: Email addresses and phone numbers for customer support
- **Address**: Physical business address that appears on invoices and legal documents
- **Tax Information**: Tax identification numbers and default tax rates
- **Notification Preferences**: Control which automated notifications are sent to customers

## Why Use Multiple Brands?

There are several reasons you might want to set up multiple brands in BillaBear:

1. **Different Business Units**: If your company operates multiple business units with distinct identities
2. **White-Labelling**: If you provide services on behalf of partners or clients
3. **Regional Variations**: If you operate in multiple countries with different legal entities
4. **Product Differentiation**: If you want to present different product lines under separate brands

## Managing Brand Settings

Brand settings can be accessed through the Settings menu in the BillaBear admin interface. From there, you can:

- View a list of all configured brands
- Create new brands
- Edit existing brand settings
- Set a default brand for new customers

Each customer in BillaBear is associated with a specific brand, determining how communications with that customer are branded.
