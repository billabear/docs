Audit Logging is an a useful functionality that allows you to see who has done what and when. It can also be a very useful functionality for when issues need to be escalated during customer support queries.

With audit logs you're able to see what has been viewed as well as saved changed to important data. For log entries relating to save changes you're able to see the old value as well as the new value. 

There are four audit log trails you can view:

* Overall - This shows everything
* Customer - This shows everything for a customer
* Subscription - This shows everything for a subscription
* Billing Admin - This shows everything a billing admin has done.

When viewing the logs you can expand the log to see the context relating to the log. You'll also be able to see which Billing Admin was responsible for the log entry.
